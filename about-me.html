          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I’m an IT/Cybersecurity professional with over two decades of experience, having worked across federal systems, cloud environments, ERP solutions, and academic institutions. I’ve worn many hats—consultant, engineer, and now a Cybersecurity Instructor at Clarusway Online.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the field evolved, so did I. I’ve grown from technical tinkering to mentoring others and exploring how cybersecurity intersects with mental health. This site is my outlet for awareness, education, and inspiration.
